# Current Project State: Living NFT System

## Overview
This document outlines the current implementation status of the Living NFT system with social relationships. This is the initial development phase, with plans to expand based on AI Studio collaboration for visual and interactive elements.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Basic NFT Structure
- **Token Standard**: ERC-721 with metadata support
- **Minting**: Basic minting with image URL and metadata
- **Metadata**: Supports dynamic metadata updates

### 2. Living NFT Mechanics
- **Energy System**:
  - `energy[tokenId]`: Tracks activity level
  - `lastActionTime[tokenId]`: Timestamp of last interaction
  - `getStage()`: Returns evolution stage (0-4) based on energy

- **Stages**:
  1. Seedling (0-4 energy)
  2. Growing (5-9 energy)
  3. Mature (10-19 energy)
  4. Elder (20-49 energy)
  5. Legendary (50+ energy)

### 3. Relationship System (Basic Implementation)
- **Relationship Tracking**:
  ```solidity
  struct Edge {
      uint256 weight;
      uint256 createdAt;
      uint256 lastUpdated;
      bytes32 relationType;
  }
  ```
- **Relationship Types**: Basic support for different relationship types
- **Batch Updates**: Efficient relationship updates via `batchUpdate()`

### 4. Parent-Child Relationships (EIP-7401)
- Parent-child hierarchy support
- Methods: `attachChild()`, `detachChild()`
- Events for relationship changes

## Current Limitations (To Be Addressed)

1. **Visual Representation**
   - Basic image URL storage
   - No dynamic rendering based on traits/relationships
   - No visual feedback for relationship strengths

2. **Relationship Depth**
   - Basic relationship tracking implemented
   - Limited interaction types
   - No decay system for relationships

3. **AI Integration**
   - Placeholder structure for AI-generated content
   - No live generation or processing

## Next Steps for AI Studio Integration

### Visual Development
1. **Trait Visualization**
   - Map energy levels to visual states
   - Design relationship visual indicators
   - Create stage-based appearance variations

2. **Dynamic Generation**
   - AI-generated art based on relationship graphs
   - Evolving visual traits based on interactions
   - Animated transitions between states

3. **Interaction Design**
   - Visual feedback for relationship changes
   - Timeline of relationship development
   - Cluster visualization for NFT groups

### Technical Implementation
1. **Metadata Enhancement**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Living NFT #123",
     "description": "Dynamically evolving NFT",
     "image": "base_uri/token/123",
     "attributes": [
       {"trait_type": "Stage", "value": "Seedling"},
       {"trait_type": "Energy", "value": 3},
       {"trait_type": "Relationships", "value": 2},
       {"trait_type": "Last Active", "value": "2025-10-26T10:00:00Z"}
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **AI Integration Points**
   - On-chain events trigger AI generation
   - IPFS storage for generated assets
   - Caching layer for performance

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Mechanics (Current)
- [x] Basic NFT functionality
- [x] Energy and stage system
- [x] Relationship data structure

### Phase 2: Enhanced Relationships
- [ ] Implement relationship decay
- [ ] Add interaction types
- [ ] Visual feedback system

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- [ ] AI Studio integration
- [ ] Dynamic asset generation
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Notes for AI Studio Team
- Current implementation provides hooks for visual customization
- Relationship data is structured but needs visual representation
- Energy and stage system can drive visual complexity
- Batch updates allow for efficient processing of relationship changes
